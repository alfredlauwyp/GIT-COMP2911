/**
 * DualPoint interface.
 * 
 * Provides the interface for a "node" that consists of 
 *  two points - a point "from" and a point "to". This 
 *  interfaces allows access to these two pairs of points, 
 *  as well as providing access to the distance between these
 *  two points, and the distance between "to" of one point, to
 *  the "from" of a second point.
